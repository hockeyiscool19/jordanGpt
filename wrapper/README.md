# JordanGpt

- **Introduction:**

JordanGpt implements a Flask API which exposes both a chatbot trained on Jordan's resume, job history, and engineered promps in addition to generic API routes which expose information about Jordan's career and interests. This API is supposed to serve a similar function to a personal website, but with a backend and data flare, displaying knowledge of model deployment, prompt engineering, databases, RESTful APIs, system design, and data collection. Finally, I hope to share a little bit of my youthful creativity, playfully and tastefully combining various domains.

- **Who is this repository for?**

On the one hand, I would like to make this repository accessible for recruiters and hiring managers to look at. That is, here are the skills I can bring to your team -- API development, NoSQL databases, prompt engineering, model tuning and deployment, data collection, containerization, web hosting. On the other hand, I hope to make this repository accessible for other developers, looking to tune there own models, containerize applications, and deploy their own software. The balance is delicate, so I hope to toe this fine line.
