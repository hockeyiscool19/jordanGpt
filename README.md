# JordanGpt

- **Introduction:**

I am not a company executive; therefore, I have no secretary, but, with the power of AI, I made the next best thing: JordanGpt. JordanGpt serves as my personal secretary, answering questions about my experience and career. JordanGpt exposes generic routes exposing information about my resume and work experience, in addition to a fine tuned chat bot, trained to be my secretary. This Flask API serves a similar function to a personal website, but with a backend and data flare, displaying knowledge of model deployment, prompt engineering, databases, RESTful APIs, system design, and data collection. This the front end is a rudimentary static web page. Finally, I hope to share a little bit of my youthful creativity, playfully and tastefully combining various domains.

Disclaimer: This bot collects anonymized data -- i.e., what information was accessed and what questions and answers were asked to the chatbot.

- **System Requirements and Design**

Requirements:

1. Cheap: keep cost under 20$ per month
2. Portable: app should run anywhere
3. Technologies must be easy to use
4. Open source: better to use free and open source technologies
5. Need cheap NoSql database capable of storing json data -- since openai trains on jsonl data
6. Tested: each route should be tested

Design:

My system design falls under two categories: app/API design and LLM model design.
