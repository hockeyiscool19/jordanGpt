# JordanGpt

- **Introduction:**

JordanGpt implements a Flask API which exposes both a chatbot trained on Jordan's resume, job history, and engineered promps in addition to generic API routes which expose information about Jordan's career and interests. This API is supposed to serve a similar function to a personal website, but with a backend and data flare, displaying knowledge of model deployment, prompt engineering, databases, RESTful APIs, system design, and data collection. Finally, I hope to share a little bit of my youthful creativity, playfully and tastefully combining various domains.
